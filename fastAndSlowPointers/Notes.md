These algorithms rely on Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. It relies on two variables, acting as pointers that start at the head of a linked list, or the input number itself for an algo such as Happy Number. One pointer moves slowly at a pace of one space at a time. The other pointer moves faster at a pace of two spaces at a time. If at any point they meet, there is definitely a cycle present, because the fast pointer will "lap" the slow pointer.
