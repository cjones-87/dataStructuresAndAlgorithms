/*
We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with sequence number 4. Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n) time & without using any extra space. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.
